- ✅ **Required keywords**: None required

### For Indian Projects (Core Requirements Maintained)

- ✅ **Client payment verification**: Must be UNVERIFIED
- ✅ **Client deposits**: Must have NO deposits
- ✅ **Client payment method**: Must have NO payment method

## Expected Results

With these changes, the bot should now:

1. **Bid on more projects** - Significantly increased project acceptance rate
2. **Maintain Indian requirements** - Still targets unverified clients for INR projects
3. **Lower budget projects** - Accepts projects with smaller budgets
4. **Less competition sensitive** - Bids on projects with up to 50 existing bids
5. **More flexible quality** - Accepts projects with shorter descriptions and lower quality scores

## Monitoring

The bot will now log:
- More projects passing through filters
- Higher bid placement rates
- Indian projects still filtered according to core requirements
- Detailed statistics on filtering decisions

## Safety Features Maintained

- **Spam filtering**: Still active
- **Suspicious keywords**: Still filtered out
- **Error handling**: Robust error recovery
- **Rate limiting**: API limits respected
- **Daily limits**: Prevents over-bidding

## Usage

The bot is now ready to run with more lenient filtering:

```bash
python autowork_minimal.py
```

You should see:
- More projects being analyzed
- Higher acceptance rates
- More bids being placed
- Indian projects still following specific requirements

## Fine-tuning

If you need to adjust further:

1. **For even more lenient filtering**: Reduce quality score to 10-15
2. **For stricter Indian filtering**: Increase INR budget back to ₹10,000-15,000
3. **For more competition**: Increase max bids to 60-70
4. **For higher budgets**: Increase min profitable budget to $75-100

The bot is now configured for maximum project coverage while maintaining your core Indian project requirements!
