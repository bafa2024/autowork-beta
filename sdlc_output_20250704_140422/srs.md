# Software Requirements Specification

## AutoMarketer

### Overview
This document outlines the software requirements for AutoMarketer, a high complexity api project.

### Scope
The project encompasses development of a complete api with estimated 200 hours of development effort.

### Functional Requirements
- **FR001**: up system, and be capable of dialing 20, 30, 40, or even 50 calls at once, because in the USA, most calls go to voicemail, so when there are more agents, we can increase the dialing speed to make sure agents get connected to live customers
- **FR002**: pulls data from and pushes call outcomes back into your CRM
- **FR003**: speak with them directly and collect all the necessary information
- **FR004**: choose the voice we want to use
- **FR005**: handle simultaneous calling, for example, if 10 or 15 agents are working, it should be able to dial calls on a large scale, and as soon as someone picks up, the call should be automatically connected to a live agent
- **FR006**: automatically detect whether it's a voicemail or a live customer
- **FR007**: Time Analytics Dashboard
- **FR008**: based detection to skip or leave a pre-recorded message
- **FR009**: up, etc
- **FR010**: create as many AI agents as needed at any time, with no limitation

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR001** (Performance): System should respond within 2 seconds for all user interactions
- **NFR002** (Security): All data transmissions must be encrypted using industry standards
- **NFR003** (Usability): Interface should be intuitive and require minimal training
- **NFR004** (Reliability): System uptime should be 99.9% excluding scheduled maintenance
